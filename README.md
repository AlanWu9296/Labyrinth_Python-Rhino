# Labyrinth_Python-Rhino

These are the Rhino Python scripts that can creat different labyrinths. The algorithms are origined from the book Maze for Programmers but are not translated into Rhino Python in a word-to-word way.

It's now only for 2D rectangle grid mazes.

The project is still on working!


## How to Use:
Use test.py to test all the algorithms and you can look for all available different maze creation methods in MazeMethod.py file.
